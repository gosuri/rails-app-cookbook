# Introduction

This chef cookbook setups an example [rails app](https://github.com/gosuri/rails-app) using the [AWS RDS](https://github.com/gosuri/aws-rds-cookbook) cookbook

# Requirements

* Git
* Chef 11.4+
* Ruby 1.9.3+
* AWS Credentials

## Non-Gem Dependencies

* [Vagrant 1.3.5+](http://www.vagrantup.com)
* [vagrant-aws 1.3.4](https://github.com/): Install using: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws`
* [vagrant-env 0.0.2](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env): Install using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-env`
* [vagrant-berkshelf 1.3.4](https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf): Install using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`

## Usage

1. Clone the repo

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gosuri/rails-app-cookbook.git
   cd rails-app-cookbook
   ```

2. Create the ```web``` EC2 security groups

   Create a security group called `web` and open 22 (SSH) and  80 (HTTP) ports.  It should be available at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=SecurityGroups

   It'll look something like in the image below

3. Add ```web``` EC2 security to ```default``` RDS security group
   
   In order to make the rds instance available to the ec2 instance, you will need to add the ```web``` ec2 security group to ```default``` rds security group.  It should be available at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#securitygroup:ids=default

   It'll look something like this:
   ![Web Security Group](docs/rds-sec.png)

4. Place AWS credentials in ```.env``` file
   
   Place .env that contains your *AWS credentials* under ```.env```. You can use the sample ```.env.sample``` to get started

   ```
   cat > .env <<ENV
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
   export AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME=xxx
   ENV
   ```

5. Install gem dependencies

   First you'll need bundler which can be installed with a simple `gem install bundler`. Afterwords, do the following:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

6. Provision an AWS instance

   ```
   source .env && vagrant up --provider=aws
   ```

   If the provisioning fails you can restart it using ```vagrant provision```

7. Point your browser to the newly created ec2 instanstance and you should see 'It works!'

# Recipes

* ```default.rb```: The default recipe creates an rds instance and setups the rails app with unicorn and nginx
